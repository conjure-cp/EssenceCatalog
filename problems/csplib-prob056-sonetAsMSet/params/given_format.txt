Dear Barbara,

Please excuse the late response.  I've been out of town and I'm afraid
that your message got buried.  

Attached is a zipped file, sset.zip.  These contain three sets of 15
problems.  The ones you're interested in are the problems contained in
the third set.  Files are named "sXringY", where X is the set (again,
you're interested in X = 3) and Y is the instance (Y ranges from 1 to
15).

Each of the problems are simple data files.  To describe the format of
these problem, consider the following parameter definitions (as defined
in the paper).  n = number of nodes in the demand graph, m = available
SONET rings to route the demand, b = maximum amount of demand allowed on
any one ring, r = maximum number of nodes allowed to be placed on any
one ring.  Also, let "a" be the number of arcs that exist in the demand
graph. 
 
Each file is formatted as follows.

n m b r a
list of inter-node demands for each arc in the graph
list of origin nodes for each arc in the graph
list of destination nodes for each arc in the graph

For example, the following SONET problem:

5 3 15 4 6
1 8 4 2 3 5
1 1 1 2 3 3
2 3 4 3 4 5

has 5 nodes and 6 arcs in the demand graph.  These arcs are (1,2) with 1
demand unit, (1,3) with 8 demand units, (1,4) with 4 demand units, (2,3)
with 2 demand units, (3,4) with 3 demand units, and (3,5) with 5 demand
units.

Three SONET rings are available to route this demand in this problem. 
Each ring should route no more than 15 demand units and should be
attached to no more than 4 nodes.

Please contact me if I can answer any questions or provide any more
assistance.

Sincerely,
Cole

ps:  Set 1 has 7 nodes per problem, Set 2 has 10 nodes per problem, and
Set 3 has 13 nodes per problem.  Other parameter descriptions for each
set are provided in the paper.
